          <h2>What's in a logo</h2>
          <p>I’m often asked to just design a logo for someone and place it on a business card or some stationery. I feel that for some, a logo is nothing more than an afterthought, like turning up in a nice suit but wearing a funny hat because it was raining. In reality however, brand and identity is so much more. Type, tone-of-voice, colours , imagery, space and composition all create a visual language that represents how you wish to be seen and perceived. It can range from just a business card, to a full blown set of guidelines, but every element should be considered and thought through. </p>

                  <p>As a key member of the in-house design team, it was my role to look at evolving the branding of the company. We decided to remove the existing blue used throughout the stores and make the brand, signage and any other material, black and white. We introduced a new typeface and implemented that across all signage and ticketing.</p>

                  <p>Early in my career I was involved in helping to create a street signage system for the <strong>City of London</strong>. We had a typeface cut and we created a letter spacing system. This system used a cross reference chart where each character used 1 of a 4 step space bar relating to the character before it. By using this system all the signage across the City would have a consistency regardless of who created it.</p>

                  <p>Having designed the original identity, website and appraisal system for SARD and as the company had grown offering more solutions they returned requesting a refresh. Keeping the original look and feel I made some changes to the logo, created a series of icons and updated the look of the website. This also included a more comprehensive set of guidelines and some brochures.</p>

                  <p>The final design uses a tight grid structure, colour palette and use of typography to create a unified identity. The samples below are of the guidelines, stationery, invite and website. The website needed to be a responsive design that could be viewed on various devices and could be updated regularly by Wildstone themselves. Content in Motion and Pragmatic Web were fantastic at following my designs through to final build.</p>
