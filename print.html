                      <p>I design the <strong>Transmitter</strong> magazine, a high-quality free publication for and about the Crystal Palace area of London. The Transmitter team wanted to refresh the format and typography, while also having the flexibility to allow larger features to have a more bespoke design so that they could stand out within the magazine. The aim was to provide a smart, consistent, good-looking format that could be easily and creatively applied to each issue, building a familiar style but with each issue making its own mark as a one-off.</p>
            
                      <p>I looked at the grid structure, and typography. On each issue I work with the editorial team to provide bespoke designs for the main features and the cover. I then complete the artwork and prepare the magazine for print. I also helped to redefine the print spec, and with some simple changes to size and format, helped the team make a significant saving on their print bill without any noticeable loss of quality or content.</p>

                      <h3>Wall Calendar</h3>
            
                      <p>I was commissioned to create this unique two-sided A2 calendar for <strong>The Artworks Illustration Agency</strong>. Each of the twelve branches features the work of one of their artists: a nice 'year round' showcase for the agency's talent.</p>
            
                      <p>The Artworks wanted to find a way to show the work of their artists as individuals but also bring them together collectively to demonstrate the portfolio of the agency. New 'Startworks' artist Stacey Knights played a key role in the design â creating the tree, the canopy of the leaves as well as all of the month names and dates, and the design of the floating leaves on the envelope. My involvement was to work with Stacey and The Artworks to produce a template that went out to each illustrator so that they could create their chosen branch to fit the design and colour palette, but in their own distinctive style. I then completed the output, which included final artwork, some retouching, colour correction, text placement and preparation for print. The calendar is printed on uncoated stock and looks amazing on any wall.</p>
