          <h3>Street Signage System</h3>

          <p>Early in my career I was involved in helping to create a street signage system for the <strong>City of London</strong>. We had a typeface cut and we created a letter spacing system. This system used a cross reference chart where each character used 1 of a 4 step space bar relating to the character before it. By using this system all the signage across the City would have a consistency regardless of who created it.</p>
