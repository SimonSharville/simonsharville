          <h3>Images Awards book and exhibition graphics</h3> 

          <p>I was given the brief to design the yearly <strong>Images Awards</strong> for the Association of Illustrators, Each year needed to have it's own distinctive look that followed through from the book to the awards ceremony and exhibition graphics.</p>

          <p>Most years I did this alone working closely with their team, however one year Adrian Shaughnessy was brought in as Art Director.</p>
