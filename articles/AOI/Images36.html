          <h3>Images 36</h3> 
          <p>For Images 36, the AOI required a minimal, clean design that would allow the illustrations to occupy the creative high ground.</p>

          <p>With a warm grey cover with a white spine and clean, industrial typography with a tiny flash of orange that hinted at the promise of colour inside. The structure of the inside was even tighter than previous years, with all the information relating to an illustration, other than the name and title, removed to the index. This allowed for a much tidier page layout and more room for the illustrations.</p>

          <p>A design trophy for the award winners followed the book design, mounted in an acrylic block.</p>
