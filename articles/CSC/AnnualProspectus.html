          <h3>Annual Prospectus</h3> 
          <p>Annual prospectus design for the <strong>Clinical Sciences Centre</strong>. Promoting the Centre to potential students.
          The brief was to create a clear and strong design that allowed for a lot of information with footnotes and diagrams but that each subject page must be identical in layout. I created a hierarchal grid that allowed for different lengths of title and content but using a different key colour relative to their section.</p>
