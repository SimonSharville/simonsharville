          <h3>JISC Access Unlimited Brochure</h3> 
          <p>Designs for an interactive brochure to demonstrate the benefits of UK colleges and universities becoming a service provider in the UK federation, streamlining and delivering access to institutional services via secure access management. The design had to look like a printed brochure, but be an interactive PDF containing video. <strong>JISC</strong> had very tight design principles, the structure had to be identical to other brochures they had produced, but the type, colours and graphics could be experimented with.</p>
