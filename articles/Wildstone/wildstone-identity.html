          <h1>Wildstone Outdoor Media</h1>
          
          <h2>Brand identity and website</h2>
          <p>Design for a new visual identity for Outdoor Media Specialists, <strong>Wildstone</strong>, who develop prime outdoor digital and large format advertising sites, helping landlords and property developers as well as local authorities turn passive spaces into highly desirable media locations.</p>

          <p>The brief was to evolve the existing logo and then create a strong visual language that could be used across all their print and digital communications.</p>

          <p>The final design uses a tight grid structure, colour palette and use of typography to create a unified identity. The samples below are of the guidelines, stationery, invite and website. The website needed to be a responsive design that could be viewed on various devices and could be updated regularly by Wildstone themselves. Content in Motion and Pragmatic Web were fantastic at following my designs through to final build.</p>
