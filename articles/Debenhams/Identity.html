          <h3>Brand Identity and Signage</h3>

          <p>As a key member of the in-house design team, it was my role to look at evolving the branding of the company. We decided to remove the existing blue used throughout the stores and make the brand, signage and any other material, black and white. We introduced a new typeface and implemented that across all signage and ticketing.</p>
