          <h2>Website designs</h2>
          <p>Inside Job were a relocation service that focused on large corporate moves but with a environmental agenda. In partnership with Gunpowder Studios we created a brand identity and website. We got as far as the design process which was all approved when they suddenly merged with another company to become Go Green, basically doing the same under a new name. We were asked to amend the designs and create a new brand, but on a much smaller scale and budget. The end result was a completely different look and feel and a much smaller website. From a design point it became a bit of a compromise and I think the Inside Job was much stronger, but that's what can happen when a client suddenly changes half way through a job. So it goes.</p>
