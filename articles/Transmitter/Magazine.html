          <p>I design the <strong>Transmitter</strong> magazine, a high-quality free publication for and about the Crystal Palace area of London. The Transmitter team wanted to refresh the format and typography, while also having the flexibility to allow larger features to have a more bespoke design so that they could stand out within the magazine. The aim was to provide a smart, consistent, good-looking format that could be easily and creatively applied to each issue, building a familiar style but with each issue making its own mark as a one-off.</p>

          <p>I looked at the grid structure, and typography. On each issue I work with the editorial team to provide bespoke designs for the main features and the cover. I then complete the artwork and prepare the magazine for print. I also helped to redefine the print spec, and with some simple changes to size and format, helped the team make a significant saving on their print bill without any noticeable loss of quality or content.</p>
