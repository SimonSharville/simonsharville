          <h3>Book of Hugs</h3> 

          <p>I was commissioned through WWAV Rapp Collins to design a book for the <strong>NSPCC</strong>. A one-off production showing over 4,000 quotes from members of the public. Each spread had to be unique in layout but use only 4 separate colours and be based around circles and the green dot of their logo. The final book was put on display in the foyer of their new flagship office in Liverpool.</p>
