          <h3>Wall Calendar</h3>

          <p>I was commissioned to create this unique two-sided A2 calendar for <strong>The Artworks Illustration Agency</strong>. Each of the twelve branches features the work of one of their artists: a nice 'year round' showcase for the agency's talent.</p>

          <p>The Artworks wanted to find a way to show the work of their artists as individuals but also bring them together collectively to demonstrate the portfolio of the agency. New 'Startworks' artist Stacey Knights played a key role in the design â€“ creating the tree, the canopy of the leaves as well as all of the month names and dates, and the design of the floating leaves on the envelope. My involvement was to work with Stacey and The Artworks to produce a template that went out to each illustrator so that they could create their chosen branch to fit the design and colour palette, but in their own distinctive style. I then completed the output, which included final artwork, some retouching, colour correction, text placement and preparation for print. The calendar is printed on uncoated stock and looks amazing on any wall.</p>
